# MSc-thesis: 'Probing shallow subsurface water on Mars through bi-static radar measurements at UHF wavelengths'

Mapping shallow subsurface water (ice) on near-equatorial Mars is critical for future (manned) exploration, yet existing research shows poor correlation, leaving its presence debated.

This thesis assesses dual-spacecraft Bi-Static Radar (BSR) measurement feasibility at Ultra High Frequency, providing near-global coverage ideal for comparison with gamma/neutron spectrometry hydrogen maps. The Mars Express lander relay antenna transmits a continuous signal probing a few metres into the subsurface (shallow depths which cannot be mapped by conventional low-frequency radar). The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter receives the echo, whose amplitude directly reflects permittivity variations induced by compositional changes, e.g. water (ice) deposits.

Models were created to optimize measurement planning and simulate the received power spectrum against BSR data. The current match is limited, reflecting the methodâ€™s novelty, and surface composition is yet to show a strong signature. However, after calibration, resolution increase and improving direct signal, seasonal and polarization effects modelling, reliable detections appear possible.
